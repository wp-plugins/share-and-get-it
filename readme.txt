Share&Get it ! automatically provides you with either Facebook fans or Twitter followers in return for downloadable content

Once youâ€™ve installed Share&Get it ! on your WordPress website, your number of visitors will dramatically increase in no time.

Our team will be glad to answer your questions, solve your problems and listen to your suggestions. 

= What is the Share&Get it ! button? =
It is a button type plugin that enables you to offer files for download on your WordPress site and in return be promoted on social networks.

Facebook and Twitter have an endless potential when it comes to put you atop of the game.   

The button can be inserted wherever you want (posts, pages, widgets â€¦)


= Can I upload any type of file via Share&Get it ! ? =

In terms of format, you can upload anything from music, documents, tutorials, photos, Ebooks, wallpapers, videos to icons, PSD brushes, CMS Themes, software, Web resources, coupons, typography and so many more.

When it comes to size limit, go check in your server configuration (max_upload_size in your php.ini file).

= Is Share & Get it entirely for free ? =

Yes, Share & Get it ! is a 100% free service.

= Is there a maximum number of buttons I can create? =

Absolutely not! You can create as many as you want. Possibilities are endless!

= What if I have no Facebook page and no Twitter account? =
Donâ€™t you worry! Of course you can still use the plugin and people clicking the button will still send the promotional message you set up when installing the plugin. The only difference is the person downloading your file wonâ€™t be fan of any Facebook page and wonâ€™t be following any Twitter account. 

= Is it possible to use a different Twitter account of Facebook Fan page per button? =

Yes, of course!

= Is it possible to set up a different promotional Facebook post for every button ? =

Yes it is ! Remember that when creating a new button, you have to fill in a specific form for each button.  You are thus free to configure any message and to link it to any account (Facebook or Twitter) you wish.   

= Is it possible to set up a different promotional tweet per button? =
Of course it is ! As explained above, buttons are all independent. 

= Is it possible to provide a file to via an URL that's external to my WordPress site? =
It is indeed possible. You can upload a file from your hard drive or just give the URL of your file's location.

= My file wonâ€™t upload. What should I do? =
First, make sure Safe Mode is Off on your server configuration. If you canâ€™t or donâ€™t want to, create a shareandgetit folder manually in your WordPress Uploads.

http://myblog/wp-content/uploads/shareandgetit

When creating the folder, it has to have 777 chmod permission.

Now it should work.

= Even though Safe Mode is off, I still canâ€™t upload my files! What now? =

Verify there is a folder named Uploads in your blog at http://myblog/wp-content/uploads/

If not, give the wp-content folder 777 chmode permission so that the plugin can automatically create the uploads folder needed.

= I still need some tech support ! =
